# AMES-Housing-Analysis-in-SAS-Studio

*Business Problem:*
The data analysis team has to come up with a reliable and significant model to predict the house prices in the city of Ames, Iowa for the real estate company named: Ames Real Estate Associates (AREA). In addition to predicting house prices with good accuracy, the data analysis team must also provide the real estate company with the factors that are likely to influence the prices of houses. The magnitude by which the selected factors are influencing the house price is also to be determined so as to invest proportionately for improving the house quality. Also, the prime time at which the house is to be sold must also be determined to get the best price for it. These factors would then be advised by the AREA team to its customers to get a better price for the homes they are planning to sell. 

*Motivation:*
After COVID-19, many people have become financially literate. Everyone is trying to look for investment opportunities. House and land areas are a great and sustainable form of investment in the highly developing world scenario. Thus, we have decided to know the current market trend for housing prices specifically to Ames area, unlike the online house pricing websites which are trained on larger areas for a wider customer group.  

*Business Questions the analysis will attempt to answer:*
-	What is the expected selling price of a house with particular features?
-	Which factors influence the price of a house?
-	What is the magnitude of their influence?
-	When is the best time to sell, or buy a house?
-	How much should I invest in improving the condition of my home in order to increase the expected price by more than the cost of improvements?
-	Which homes should I compare my house to? 
-	Which neighborhoods have houses with the highest selling price?
-	Are old homes costlier than new ones for their antiquity?
